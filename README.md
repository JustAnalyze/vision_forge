# Vision Forge

#### Video Demo: (Coming Soon)

#### Description:
Vision Forge is an intuitive application designed for creating, training, and utilizing image classification models through a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI). This app eliminates the need for any coding, making it accessible to users of all skill levels.

### Features:
- **Custom Model Creation:** Customize your image classification models with options to select task type, pretrained models, optimizers, epochs, hidden units/neurons, and learning rate.
- **Data Loading:** Easily load your dataset, and the app will automatically infer the number of classes and the train/test split based on the selected data folder. You can manually adjust the batch size if needed. The app manages data loading in minibatches for efficient training.
- **Model Training:** Train your customized model with the click of a button.
- **Prediction:** Use the trained model to make predictions on new images, all through the simple GUI.

### GUI Overview:
Here is a preview of the GUI for your reference:

- **Data Augmentation:** Basic data augmentation transforms are included to improve model generalization. These transforms include:
  ```python
  torchvision.transforms.Compose([
      T.RandomHorizontalFlip(p=0.5),
      T.RandomVerticalFlip(p=0.25),
      T.RandomRotation(degrees=30),
      T.ColorJitter(brightness=0.2, contrast=0.2, saturation=0.2, hue=0.1)
  ])
  ```
